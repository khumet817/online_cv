                                I'm Tabile Khume. I am an attentive listener. I am patient and a smart worker. I pay
                                attention to detail. I always seek new challenges that will improve my work. I am
                                aware of my capabilities and my limits. I have good social skills which will be
                                beneficial at the work place. I have developed an undying passion for coding. It was
                                never my first choice but it has now become my first love. It began with my father,
                                who is a high school teacher, continuously nagging me to go through the IT and CAT
                                textbooks that flooded our home. Perhaps it is my calling.
                            </p>

                                "You do not have to be great in order to start. You do however need to start in order
                                to be great."
                            </p>

                                Here I am, doing what I enjoy. Besides coding I enjoy doing motivational speaking, play
                                sports such as soccer, basketball and cricket. I enjoy being indoors just as much I do being
                                outdoors. I read, spend time with my family and play Xbox or PlayStation games. I find a 
                                balance between my social life and my professional life. With all these I believe the 
                                following are important and valuable traits or rather skills that will be beneficial 
                                towards my profession.
